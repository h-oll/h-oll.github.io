I'm involved in several projects in France and in Europe that provide funding and research collaborations for young and talented researchers interested in joining the team.

- SecNISQ: designing better protocols for secure quantum computation in the NISQ regime
- NISQ2LSQ: error correction and error mitigation for bosonic systems
- Equality: noise estimation and noise mitigation using verification tools
- Quantum Internet Alliance: use case development and simulation for metropolitan quantum networks

Past projects
- QML-CAT: machine learning with cat qubits
