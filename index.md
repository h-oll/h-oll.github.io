# Opening of a Postdoctoral Position (24 months)

## Quantum Cryptography and Verification of Quantum Computation

## Context

The position is part of an ongoing research program on the verification of quantum computation and the development of advanced cryptographic primitives for both near-term and long-term quantum architectures. The group’s recent contributions include novel protocols for delegated quantum computation, refined verification techniques, and secure computation frameworks exploiting both information-theoretic and computational assumptions. The postdoctoral researcher expected to contribute to extending these results and exploring new lines of inquiry at the interface of quantum cryptography, complexity theory, and practical implementations.


## Scientific Objectives

The selected candidate will work on one or several of the following axes:

### Reducing overhead in verification protocols

A central goal is to refine known verification schemes—both interactive and non-interactive—to reach practical overheads compatible with proof-of-concept demonstrations on current noisy quantum devices. This includes:

-   Improving round complexity, classical and quantum communication costs, and quantum resource requirements;
-   Designing verification procedures that tolerate realistic noise models without sacrificing cryptographic guarantees;
-   Investigating compilation and optimization strategies for verification circuits, including hybrid classical–quantum approaches.


### Extending the toolbox of secure quantum functionalities

The project aims to develop new cryptographic primitives or enhance existing ones to broaden the landscape of secure quantum protocols. Potential directions include:

-   Computationally secure remote state preparation with reduced quantum capabilities on the client side;
-   Succinct quantum protocols, with a focus on minimizing transcript size and verifier complexity;
-   Using complexity-theoretic reductions to build cryptographically meaningful trade-offs between security, assumptions, and resource costs;
-   Robustness of protocols to noise either in the NISQ or FTQC regimes.


### Exploring new research questions in quantum cryptography

The postdoc will have the opportunity to pursue innovative topics at the frontier of quantum cryptography, such as:

-   Zero-knowledge proof systems in the quantum setting, with emphasis on MPC-in-the-Head techniques and possible quantum adaptations;
-   Cryptographic constructions for quantum money, including public-key or noise-tolerant schemes, and security analyses based on quantum complexity assumptions;
-   Connections between these primitives and the verification of quantum computations, leading to unified frameworks or cross-applicable tools.


## Candidate Profile

A strong background is expected in at least one of the following areas:

-   Quantum cryptography, post-quantum cryptography, or interactive proof systems;
-   Quantum complexity theory or quantum information theory;
-   Verification of quantum computation or delegated quantum computation;
-   Secure computation, zero-knowledge proofs, MPC, or related cryptographic domains.

Experience with practical implementations on NISQ devices is a plus but not required. A demonstrated capacity for independent, rigorous and mathematically oriented research is essential.


## Working Environment

The postdoctoral researcher will join the QAT team, hosted at the Département d’Informatique of the École Normale Supérieure (DI-ENS) in Paris. The group offers an active and intellectually vibrant environment at the intersection of quantum information, cryptography, and complexity theory. The team maintains strong collaborations with national and international partners and participates in broader initiatives in quantum technologies. The position is for 24 months, with competitive salary and support for travel and dissemination.


## How to Apply

Applicants should send to [qat-hiring@inria.fr](mailto:qat-hiring@inria.fr):

-   A CV including publications,
-   A brief research statement (1–2 pages),
-   Contact information for two or three reference letters.
