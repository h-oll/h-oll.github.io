<h1>Prospective students and postdocs</h1>

- **PhD**: I am looking for a highly motivated PhD student to be
  co-supervised with Pr. Elham Kashefi at LIP6 to work on quantum
  cryptographic primitives and quantum complexity. Reach out to me if
  you are interested with a CV, grades from your Master and name of 2
  or 3 persons who would be willing to write recommendation letters.

- **Postdocs**: I am funding 2-year postdoctoral fellowships on
  quantum cryptography, quantum complexity, benchmarking, quantum
  machine learning and noise mitigation. If your interests match these
  domains and you feel motivated by the projects I am working on, send
  me an email with a CV, a list of publications and the names of 2 or
  3 persons willing to write recommendation letters.

- **Software Engineers**: I am committed to developing benchmarking
  software for simulation frameworks as well as for real
  hardware. More broadly, the team is looking for software engineers
  who have a solid math background as well as an expertise working on
  scientific computation or cryptography related projects. If you want
  to know more, you can send an email to
  [qat-hiring@inria.fr](mailto:qat-hiring@inria.fr).
