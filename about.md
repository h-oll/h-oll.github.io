I joined INRIA april 2021 after 2 years at LIP6 CNRS. I started
research on quantum information in 2000 at Los Alamos National Lab
with W.H. Zurek working on decoherence â€” introducing quantum discord
and the first characterizations of quantum darwinism. I joined
Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics as a Postdoctoral fellow,
working mainly on quantum error correction and quantum algorithms.

I paused research in 2007 switching to corporate finance at the
Ministry of Finance, then rapidly joining a private equity fund and
finally launching a successful M&A boutique that soon reached more
than 25 professionals and 5 offices across France. At the end of 2017,
I founded an AI-based startup for reconstructing hidden professional
network in the corporate finance space.

I currently head the [QAT team](https://qat.inria.fr) and the
[QuantumTech@INRIA program](https://quantumtech.inria.fr).
